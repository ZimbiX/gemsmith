Gemsmith is a command line interface for smithing Ruby gems. Perfect for when you need a
professional and robust tool beyond link:https://bundler.io[Bundler]'s basic gem skeletons. While
Bundler is great for creating your first gem, you'll quickly outgrow Bundler when creating and
maintaining multiple gems. This is where Gemsmith can increase your productivity by providing much
of the tooling you need from the start with the ability to customize as desired.

-T`):

....
rake build                 # Build example-0.1.0.gem package
rake bundle:audit          # Updates the ruby-advisory-db then runs bundle-audit
rake clean                 # Clean gem artifacts
rake code_quality          # Run code quality checks
rake git_lint              # Run Git Lint
rake install               # Install example-0.1.0.gem package
rake publish               # Build, tag as 0.1.0 (unsigned), and push example-0.1.0.gem to RubyGems
rake reek                  # Check for code smells
rake rubocop               # Run RuboCop
rake rubocop:auto_correct  # Auto-correct RuboCop offenses
rake spec                  # Run RSpec code examples
rake toc[label,includes]   # Add/Update Table of Contents (README)
....

_NOTE: Some tasks might differ depending on what options you enabled/disabled during gem
generation._

When building/testing your gem locally, a typical workflow is:

. `bundle exec rake install`
. Test your gem locally.
. Repeat until satisfied.

When satified with your gem, builds are green, and ready to publish, run:

....
bundle exec rake publish
....

=== Configuration

This gem can be configured via a global configuration:

....
$HOME/.config/gemsmith/configuration.yml
....

It can also be configured via link:https://www.alchemists.io/projects/xdg[XDG] environment variables.

The default configuration is as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
:year: <current year>
:github_user: "<Git config GitHub user>"
:gem:
  :label: "Undefined"
  :name: "undefined"
  :path: "undefined"
  :class: "Undefined"
  :platform: "Gem::Platform::RUBY"
  :url: "https://github.com/<author>/<gem name>"
  :license: "MIT"
:author:
  :name: "<Git config user name>"
  :email: "<Git config user email>"
  :url: ""
:organization:
  :name: ""
  :url: ""
:versions:
  :ruby: "<current Ruby version>"
  :rails: "5.1"
:generate:
  :bundler_audit: true
  :circle_ci: false
  :cli: false
  :engine: false
  :git_lint: true
  :git_hub: true
  :guard: true
  :pry: true
  :reek: true
  :rspec: true
  :rubocop: true
  :simple_cov: true
  :security: false
:publish:
  :sign: false
----

Feel free to take this default configuration, modify, and save as your own custom
`configuration.yml`.

=== Existing Gems

If you have gems that were not originally crafted by Gemsmith, you can add Gemsmith support to them
by modifying the following files:

Add the following to your gem's `.gemspec` file:

[source,ruby]
----
spec.add_development_dependency "gemsmith"
----

Replace or add a modified version of the following to your gem's `Rakefile`:

[source,ruby]
----
# frozen_string_literal: true

begin
  require "gemsmith/rake/setup"
rescue LoadError => error
  puts error.message
end
----

_NOTE: Ensure `require "bundler/gem_tasks"` is removed as Gemsmith replaces Bundler functionality._

With those changes, you can leverage the benefits of Gemsmith within your existing gem.

== Security

=== Git Signing Key

To securely sign your Git tags, install and configure link:https://www.gnupg.org[GPG]:

[source,bash]
----
brew install gpg
gpg --gen-key
----

When creating your GPG key, choose these settings:

* Key kind: RSA and RSA (default)
* Key size: 4096
* Key validity: 0
* Real Name: `<your name>`
* Email: `<your email>`
* Passphrase: `<your passphrase>`

To obtain your key, run the following and take the part after the forward slash:

[source,bash]
----
gpg --list-keys | grep pub
----

Add your key to your global Git configuration in the `[user]` section. Example:

....
[user]
  signingkey = <your GPG key>
....

Now, when publishing your gems with Gemsmith (i.e. `bundle exec rake publish`), signing of your Git
tag will happen automatically. You will be prompted for the GPG Passphrase each time but that is to
be expected.

=== Gem Certificates

To create a certificate for your gems, run the following:

[source,bash]
----
cd ~/.ssh
gem cert --build you@example.com
chmod 600 gem-*.pem
----

The resulting `.pem` key files can be referenced via the `:private_key:` and `:public_key:` keys
within the `$HOME/.gemsmithrc` file.

To learn more about gem certificates, read about RubyGems
link:https://guides.rubygems.org/security[Security].

== Private Gem Servers

By default, the following Rake task will publish your gem to link:https://rubygems.org[RubyGems]:

[source,bash]
----
bundle exec rake publish
----

You can change this behavior by adding metadata to your gemspec that will allow the Rake tasks,
mentioned above, to publish your gem to an alternate/private gem server instead. This can be done by
updating your gem specification and RubyGems credentials.

=== Gem Specification Metadata

Add the following metadata to your gemspec:

[source,ruby]
----
Gem::Specification.new do |spec|
  spec.metadata = {
    "allowed_push_key" => "example_key",
    "allowed_push_host" => "https://gems.example.com"
  }
end
----

The gemspec metadata keys and values _must_ be strings per the
link:https://guides.rubygems.org/specification-reference/#metadata[RubyGems Specification]. Each key
represents the following:

* `allowed_push_key`: Provides a reference (look up) to the key defined the RubyGems credentials
  file so that sensitive credentials are not used within your gemspec.
* `allowed_push_host`: Provides the URL of the private gem server to push your gem to.

=== Gem Credentials

With your gem specification metadata established, you are ready to publish your gem to a public or
private server. If this is your first time publishing a gem and no gem credentials have been
configured, you'll be prompted for them. Gem credentials are stored in the RubyGems
`$HOME/.gem/credentials` file. From this point forward, future gem publishing will use your stored
credentials instead. Multiple credentials can be stored in the `$HOME/.gem/credentials` file.
Example:

[source,yaml]
----
:rubygems_api_key: 2a0b460650e67d9b85a60e183defa376
:example_key: "Basic dXNlcjpwYXNzd29yZA=="
----

Should you need to delete a credential (due to a bad login/password for example), you can open the
`$HOME/.gem/credentials` in your default editor and remove the line(s) you don't need. Upon next
publish of your gem, you'll be prompted for the missing credentials.

== Promotion

Once your gem is released, let the world know about your accomplishment by posting an update to
these sites:

* link:http://www.rubyflow.com[RubyFlow]
* link:https://ruby.libhunt.com[Ruby Library Hunt]
* link:http://rubydaily.org[RubyDaily]
* link:https://awesome-ruby.com[Awesome Ruby]
* link:https://www.ruby-toolbox.com[Ruby Toolbox]
* link:https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/community[Ruby Community]

== Troubleshooting

When running `bundle exec rake install` or `bundle exec rake publish` with modified, staged, or
uncommitted Git changes, the rake task will throw an error to this effect. When this occurs, it is
recommended that you commit your changes or link:https://git-scm.com/docs/git-stash[stash] them
before proceeding.

== Development

To contribute, run:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/bkuhlmann/gemsmith.git
cd gemsmith
bin/setup
----

You can also use the IRB console for direct access to all objects:

[source,bash]
----
bin/console
----

== Tests

To test, run:

[source,bash]
----
bundle exec rake
----

== Versioning

Read link:https://semver.org[Semantic Versioning] for details. Briefly, it means:

* Major (X.y.z) - Incremented for any backwards incompatible public API changes.
* Minor (x.Y.z) - Incremented for new, backwards compatible, public API enhancements/fixes.
* Patch (x.y.Z) - Incremented for small, backwards compatible, bug fixes.
